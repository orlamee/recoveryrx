                <p>
                  RecoveryRx began with one mission: to offer a better path to
                  healing, one rooted in dignity, understanding, and real
                  support.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our team of clinicians and counselors saw a need for addiction
                  care that treats the whole person, not just the symptoms. So
                  we created a place where people feel safe, heard, and
                  empowered from day one.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Located in the heart of our community, RecoveryRx is more than
                  a clinic, it is a place where individuals and families could
                  find hope, healing, and a path forward. From the very
                  beginning, we committed ourselves to evidence-based practices,
                  real human connection, and the understanding that every
                  recovery journey is deeply personal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, RecoveryRx continues to grow, but our mission remains
                  the same: to walk beside each person, helping them reclaim
                  their life with strength, dignity, and support that lasts.
